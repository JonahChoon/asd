Ever since I was young, I enjoyed playing with and watching the My Little Pony TV show. Rainbow Dash was, is and will forever be my favourite character. She's so so beautiful. Too bad I live in Singapore, I can't own a pony that controls the weather :( 
Sometimes, even the news get the weather forcast wrong, imagine Rainbow Dash controlling it for me! Then I don't have to sing the rain rain go away song everytime I want to go out to play.

Thanks for reading. Next up is Bob the builder.
